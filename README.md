# 📌 Project Overview

Human Resource departments generate large amounts of employee data, but without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to extract meaningful insights.  

This project transforms raw HR data into an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides clear, data-driven insights into employee attrition, compensation distribution, workforce diversity, and overall organizational trends.

The dashboard enables HR managers and business leaders to identify workforce challenges and make strategic improvements.
